## Project💻
Breast Cancer Detection (2022-2023)

Role: Lead Developer and Researcher

Developed a CNN model to classify breast cancer images into malignant or benign categories. Utilized convolutional layers to extract features from the images and identify patterns indicative of cancer. Used predefined datasets from Kaggle to train and evaluate the model's performance. Achieved an accuracy of (mention your accuracy percentage) in classifying malignant and benign tumors.
Fake News Detection (2023-2024)

Role: Data Collector and Presentation Designer
